# My Portfolio:
Created a portfolio that showcases the core skills I've recently learned such as: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Presented my name, and links to about me, of my work and how to contact me. When the links are clicked in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section. When the page is resized the page or view the site on various screens and devices, the responsive layout that adapts to the viewport. And added a second page and also incorporated react.
